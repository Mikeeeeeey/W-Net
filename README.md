This is a private repository of codes and models for the paper "Deep learning-based virtual refocusing of images using an engineered point-spread function"
## testing the model
We provide a pre-trained model (access from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1orYtT7M93bEPabesVV-F8CniY99uTPEv?usp=sharing) and test images to perform 3D reconstruction.
To start with, install Tensorflow (recommanded anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/ Tensorflow v1.13.1). 
Run the genData.m file with Matlab in ./data folder to generate testing files.
Run the test_v1.py (enter your data and model path) to test the model.
